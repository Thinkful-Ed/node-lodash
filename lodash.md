## Functional Programming with Lodash

Level: Intermediate
Time Estimate: 
Topics: Functional styled JavaScript; Data management of Collections and Objects; Partial Application, Composition and Combinators

## Brief

It's the year 2046 and you are the lead JavaScript technician for a new start-up offering "on-line dating with programming languages". It's become a global sensation as people are looking to daily flirt with some code. Your service takes the user's personal interests and matches them up with specially moulded courses.

After a chat with the lead architect, some unit tests were agreed on for functions you should write. The functions are divided into node data management and client side request builders. The data management functions will be used in the node server when responding to API requests. The client side request builders will be used for making those requests using one of the now 100 types of AJAX protocols.

## MileStones

1. Clone the repository containing a starter point and some unit tests.
2. Install the project by running `npm install`.
3. Go through the /src/ files starting with `01-*.js` and implement the functions one at a time by passing the tests.
4. Keep running the test suite using `npm test` to see if your functions meet the requirements.
5. Try to make the code as eloquent and functional as possible to keep your hipster stakeholders happy.
6. Don't sneak peak at the solutions and if you do - try to implement the solutions in a different way!
