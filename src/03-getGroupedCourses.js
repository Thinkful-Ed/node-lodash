Level 3:

function getGroupedCourses() -> [[courses]]

This function must sort the languages by suitability, measured by adding `demand`, `enjoyment`, and `versatility`. For each language, ordered by most suitable to least suitable, return an array of courses offering that language. Wrap these arrays (one for each language) into one outer array and return the said outer array.
